##Grocery List in React

[Check it out!](https://grocery-list-caef5.firebaseapp.com/)

This is similar to my previous project [Grocery List in Local Storage](https://github.com/gness1804/grocery-list-local-storage), except that it is rebuilt in React and employs Firebase for better and more versatile data storage. The app can now be used by multiple users on multiple devices. For details on the earlier project, see its [readme](https://github.com/gness1804/grocery-list-local-storage/blob/gh-pages/readme.md).
